# PY-RPS
Rock Paper Scissors, written in Python.

## What do I use this for?
Anything! Implement it into a website, game, etc. You can even claim it as your own! **Note, I will not provide support in implementing this repository into your projects.**

### How do I use this?
First, make sure you have Git installed on your PC. You can find Git's download page [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Next, install Python on your PC. You can find Python's
download page [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you have both things installed, run `py -V` and `git --version` in the console to make sure their both installed.
After all of that, go into your console and run `git clone https://github.com/WheresChill/PY-RPS.git` and then edit, or use the repository as you wish.
